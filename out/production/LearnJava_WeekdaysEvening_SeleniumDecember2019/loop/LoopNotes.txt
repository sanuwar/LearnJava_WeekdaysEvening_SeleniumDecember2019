// Loop in Java:

    //Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of
    // instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true.
    // Java provides three ways for executing the loops. ... The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

    // For Loop
    // While loop
    // Do..While Loop
    // For each loop


    //When using this version of the for statement, keep in mind that:
    //
    //1. The initialization expression initializes the loop; it's executed once, as the loop begins.
    //2. When the termination expression evaluates to false, the loop terminates.
    //3. The increment expression is invoked after each iteration through the loop.
    //  It is perfectly acceptable for this expression to increment or decrement a value.




#Debugging is the routine process of locating and removing computer program bugs, errors or abnormalities,
 which is methodically handled by software programmers via debugging tools. Debugging checks, detects and
 corrects errors or bugs to allow proper program operation according to set specifications.
